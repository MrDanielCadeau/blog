A quick presentation for a template I made to use Tailwind CSS with Django.    
You can find the template on [GitHub](https://github.com/MrDanielCadeau/template-django-tailwind) and start making something great with it!
    
For more convenience, you can use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/MrDanielCadeau/template-django-tailwind) to start a workspace with the template.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

## What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

### This two technologies are a great match!
